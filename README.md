# Learn-Metric
A project to give easier access to conversions between measuring systems. Currently will give the weather conditions for current location, but requires an api key from [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev/). The key can be added to the HomeViewController, replacing the x's in the "client" property. Additional functionality is in development.
